Usage:

	* MySQL should be running on localhost:3306 with the create_schema.sql script 
	executed.
	
	* The --accessLog=/path/to/file input parameter will accept absolute path to 
	the file.
	
	* The verify_test.sql script has some queries to analyze the results from the
	runs



Some design decisions:

	* Column widths for all columns have extra space for variable data sizes. the 
	extra space is ~2x the maximum column sizes provided in the sample access.log 
	file rounded to the nearest power of 2.
	
	* When the --accessLog parameter is supplied, old values in access log table 
	will be cleared and replaced with new values from the provided file
	
	* When the parameters --startDate, --duration, and --threshold are supplied, 
	old values in the blocked ips table will be cleared and replaced with new 
	values generated by the command.
